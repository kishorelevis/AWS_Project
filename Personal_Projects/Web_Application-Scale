# Scalable Web Application Architecture on AWS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a scalable web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture leverages AWS EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and CloudWatch to ensure high availability and optimal performance. The application stores product and user-generated content on **Amazon S3**, while **CloudWatch** is used for continuous monitoring and performance optimization.

## Technologies Used:
- **AWS EC2**: Hosting the web application.
- **AWS Auto Scaling (ASG)**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic and load.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and performance optimization.
- **Amazon S3**: Storing product images and user-generated content.
- **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across EC2 instances for high availability.
- **AWS IAM**: Role-based access control for secure application deployment.


## Features:
- **Scalability**: The application automatically scales in or out based on demand using AWS Auto Scaling.
- **High Availability**: EC2 instances are distributed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure fault tolerance.
- **Performance Optimization**: CloudWatch alarms are set up to monitor metrics such as CPU utilization and network traffic, automatically triggering scaling actions or notifying the team when needed.
- **Content Storage on S3**: All product images and user-generated content are stored securely in Amazon S3 buckets. The images are made publicly accessible via S3 URLs for easy access from the web application.

## Setup Instructions:
1. **Launch EC2 Instances**: 
   - Configure EC2 instances using Amazon Machine Images (AMI).
   - Set up security groups and network configurations.
2. **Auto Scaling Group**:
   - Set up Auto Scaling to handle dynamic scaling of EC2 instances based on CPU or network utilization thresholds.
3. **Configure CloudWatch**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for key metrics (e.g., CPU utilization > 80%) to trigger scaling actions.
4. **Create an S3 Bucket for Product Images**:
   - Create an S3 bucket to store product images and user-uploaded content.
   - Set the appropriate permissions to make the content publicly accessible.
5. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
   - Set up an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across EC2 instances.

## Usage:
- The web application utilizes **Amazon S3** to store and serve product images. Product images are uploaded to S3 and are accessible through the generated URLs.
- As traffic increases, the **Auto Scaling Group** automatically adds or removes EC2 instances to ensure the application remains performant.
- Performance metrics are continuously monitored through **CloudWatch**, ensuring the application runs efficiently and scales as needed.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Containerization with Docker**: Deploy the application in Docker containers for easier scaling and management.
- **Integration with AWS RDS**: For storing structured data in a scalable relational database.
