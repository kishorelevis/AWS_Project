# üöÄ AWS Cloud Project ‚Äì Sample Architecture (Inspired by Work at Gensol Infotech)

This repository showcases a sample implementation of a cloud-native architecture using various AWS services. It reflects the kind of infrastructure and automation I‚Äôve worked on as an AWS Cloud Engineer at Gensol Infotech, adapted here as a personal project for learning and demonstration purposes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **personal project** inspired by real-world cloud deployment patterns. No proprietary or confidential company data is included.
